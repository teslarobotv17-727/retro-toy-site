      <p>As a kid, I did not grow up in a wealthy family, and money was tight. As a result, outside of birthdays and Christmases, most toys I had the privilege to play with were those inherited from my grandparents. Among these toys were G.I. Joe figures, vintage Hot Wheels cars, a wooden train set, and a Chatty Cathy.</p>
      <p>One of my favorite things to do with toys was broaden my curiousity and take them apart to see the inner workings of them. I liked seeing how things worked from the inside. I would sometimes mix-and-match my toys, as well as turn my house into a racetrack for all my cars.</p>
      <p>These toys enriched my cognitive thinking growing up, and I became more creative with my play. As such, I hold a stronger connection with these toys than the average person might. I was told from a young age to take care of what I had, because I knew I would not get replacements.</p>
      <p>Toys aren't just chunks of plastic or tin. They all had their own story, and told me lessons about caring for them in a playful way.</p>
